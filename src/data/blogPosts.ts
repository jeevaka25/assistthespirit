    content: `It's a bit arbitrary but we could say it started, roughly, when one of the docs said "You are going to be one of the few men that know the pain of birth." But c'mon. How would he know?

The surgeons were preparing to remove a large amount of soft tissue from the back of my throat. What they didn't know was that I was about to have a near-death experience that would change everything.

As the anesthesia took hold, I felt myself slipping away. But instead of darkness, there was light. Brilliant, all-encompassing light. And in that light, I understood something that years of seeking had never revealed: I was not my body. I was not my thoughts. I was something far more vast and eternal.

The experience lasted only moments in earthly time, but it contained an eternity of understanding. When I returned to my body, I knew that nothing would ever be the same. The fear that had driven so much of my life had simply... dissolved.

Was it worth it? The pain, the fear, the brush with death? Absolutely. Because on the other side of that experience was a peace that passes all understanding. A knowing that has never left me, even in the darkest moments.

This is what I share now. Not the experience itself - that was mine alone - but the peace that came from it. The understanding that we are so much more than we imagine ourselves to be.`,

    excerpt: 'When life is tumultuous we may wish for something louder than the "still small voice within." Why should it be so still?!? Or small?!?',
    content: `When life is tumultuous we may wish for something louder than the "still small voice within." Why should it be so still?!? Or small?!? ...we might ask, when we need to hear it more than ever.

And if we wish to hear this still small voice, we are best directed to... stillness itself.

In the chaos of modern life, with its constant demands and distractions, the idea of stillness can seem almost impossible. Yet it is in the quiet spaces between thoughts that we hear most clearly. Not with our ears, but with something deeper - that part of us that has always known the truth.

The voice doesn't shout because it doesn't need to. It speaks in the language of intuition, of knowing without knowing how we know. It guides us gently, never forcing, always inviting.

To hear it, we must create space. We must be willing to step away from the noise, even if only for a few moments each day. In that space, the voice becomes clear. Not because it grows louder, but because we finally learn to listen.`,

    excerpt: 'There is a way of "looking past" all the stories a person might be telling themselves; past their "egoic structure," and past all their pain and suffering...',
    content: `There is a way of "looking past" all the stories a person might be telling themselves; past their "egoic structure," and past all their pain and suffering and contracted self-concept. To what then? What is there?

This is why music and art can be so powerful... They bypass the mind entirely and speak directly to the heart.

When we meet each other as equals - not as roles, not as identities, not as our accumulated stories - something miraculous happens. The barriers fall away. The judgments dissolve. And what remains is simply... presence meeting presence.

In these moments of true meeting, healing happens naturally. Not because we try to fix each other, but because we recognize something of ourselves in the other. We see past the surface to the divine spark that animates us all.

This is the gift we can offer each other: the willingness to look past the apparent differences and meet in that place where we are one. It requires nothing but our presence and our love.`,

    title: 'The Truth of Giving & Receiving',
    excerpt: 'We sing the song of existence through our giving and receiving. Up and down the melody goes...',
    content: `We sing the song of existence through our giving and receiving. Up and down the melody goes... It is impossible to exist in this world without all manner of things coming and going.

Likewise, it is impossible we will not sometimes be giving, and sometimes receiving.

Yet we often resist this natural flow. We cling to what we have, fearing loss. Or we give with expectation, wanting something in return. Both approaches create suffering.

The truth is simpler: giving and receiving are two aspects of the same movement. When we give freely, without expectation, we open ourselves to receive. When we receive with gratitude, we create space to give again.

In the spiritual life, this cycle becomes more apparent. The peace we receive in meditation naturally flows out as compassion. The love we are given becomes love we share. There is no separation between the giver and the receiver - only the continuous flow of life itself.`,

    content: `I stood at the end of the pier. The snow-clad Olympics glistened over Puget Sound, coruscant from end to end on this particularly warm evening in April. Rigging on hundreds of boats tinkled casually amid an occasional seagull's cry, and in the distance... as is common in the Pacific Northwest... the sun was setting behind a bank of clouds.

It was an ordinary moment. And in that ordinariness, something extraordinary happened. The boundaries between self and world seemed to soften. The pier, the water, the mountains, the sky - all of it was happening within awareness, not outside of it.

This is the doorway that is always open. Not somewhere else, not in some future time when we're "enlightened enough." Right here, right now, in the midst of ordinary life.

The spiritual path is not about escaping this world for some better one. It's about recognizing that this world, exactly as it is, contains the infinite. Every moment is an invitation to step through the doorway into what we truly are.`,

    excerpt: 'As the mind stills, its thoughts still, and separation stills. In stillness, divisions fall away...',
    content: `As the mind stills, its thoughts still, and separation stills. In stillness, divisions fall away. As divisions fall away, oneness (wholeness) is at hand. And what is whole is healed.

Sometimes people come seeking healing. Sometimes physical healing, sometimes emotional, sometimes spiritual. They come with their stories of brokenness, their lists of what's wrong.

But healing doesn't come from fixing what's broken. It comes from recognizing what has never been broken. The wholeness that is our true nature doesn't need to be achieved - only recognized.

In the presence of this recognition, something shifts. Not because we've done anything, but because we've stopped doing. We've stopped trying to fix, to change, to improve. And in that stopping, what has always been whole reveals itself.

This is the healing I offer. Not my own, for I have none to give. Only the pointing toward what you already are, what you have always been, what you will always be: whole, complete, and perfectly healed.`,
